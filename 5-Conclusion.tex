\section{Conclusion}
In this essay, we motivated the need to study the problem of robustness in machine learning. We argued that game theory
is a natural framework for such a study. But, this is nothing new, since the problem of adversarial machine learning has
been studied using the formalism of game theory for more than two decades. As such, we reviewed many ideas at the intersection
of adversarial machine learnin and game theory. In particular, we reviewed adversarial machine learning in the context of
Simultaneous games, Stackelberg games and Bayesian games. Finally, we ended this essay with a discussion of the challenges ahead
at the intersection of game theory and robust machine learning. In particular, we portayed the looming issues of the recent large
scale models on our democratic institution (barely exagerating). Finally, we related how game theory can be used more generally
to study the robustness in machine learning.
